Uganda is one of the largest refugee-hosting nations in the world,with 1,529,904 refugees (as of 28 February 2022[3]). The vast influx of refugees is due to several factors in Uganda's neighboring countries, especially war and violence in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and associated economic crisis and political instability in the region. Uganda has relatively 'friendly' policies that provide rights to the refugees, such as rights to education, work, private property, healthcare and other basic social services. Wikipedia contributors.
